      rocket into the air in some direction, where they fall and break,

      this location.  The crystalline material is impossible to date.  On the
      northern facing side, etchings can be seen that appears to be a map of
      sorts.  Based on the layout of the continents, you recognize the frozen
      planet Ildathach.  Based on ground markings on the surrounding terrain,
      it appears that a number of vehicles have visited this site recently."

      close to the equator and prime meridian.  Perturbations within the
      contained artifact were relayed back to the ship over a few hours time.

      this planet surface shows that the tachyons surge is moving towards a
      point on the northern end of the equatorial island almost extremely
      enclosed in lava.  The strength of the signature is identical to a
